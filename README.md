It is one interest project,when you want to change thousands of your pictures in your database(may be Tansform\yolo),you maybe confuse and annoyed with huge files trees and pics you might ever see before(my company has datashit) if you don't wanna to coding a program to solve it ,And now i find that better in using PhotoShop to handle all of stuffs
